# Pre-work - Tipsy

Tipsy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Angie Lal

Time spent: 11.5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if < 3 mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added auto layout to the Settings View Controller

## Notes

* Spent time to better understand Optionals, and their associated error messages. 
* Instead of spending time on the aesthetics of the UI, I read a tutorial for beginners on auto layout and applied what I learned to the Settings View Controller (still have a ways to go!).
